Apr 21, 2012

Chicken seems to have stopped using getenv since after about v.
4.6.0.  Use get-environment-variable instead, which should work
for older versions too.  Rpt by Timothy Beyer.

Apr 11, 2009

Updated for Chicken Scheme 4.0.0.

Apr 10, 2009

Some support for Armed Bear Common Lisp.  However: It abbreviates long
sexprs with "...", which is no use at all.

Updated for Gambit 4.4.2.

datum->syntax-object and syntax-object->datum now are named
datum->syntax and syntax->datum.

Apr 2, 2009

Scheme quotient == CL floor.

Mar 31, 2009

Less verbose translation of cond with =>; and let*.

Mar 19, 2009

Some support for Clozure CL.

Jun 13, 2006

In previous change, => should have been <=
(greater-than-or-equals).  This was causing => in cond to
translate badly.

May 21, 2006

clnames.cl: *scm2cl-fns-named-same* should include < = > <= =>

clmacros.lsp: scheme-make-vector typo (should use make-array instead of
make-string).  Correction from Jacques Mequin, j-mequin at ti dot com.

Apr 15, 2005

getenv => posix-getenv for SBCL

Apr 12, 2005

scm2cl changes:

- Translate cond into cascaded-if only if it contains =>.  Otherwise
  preserve the cond for readability. 

- Allow eval to take a second argument, which CL will ignore.

- Recognize + - * / when they appear in non-function-call position.  (These
  have repl-related values in CL, so caused quite weird bugs, without #' in
  front of them!)

- scm2cl: Catch more instances of automatic funcall insertion.

Mar 15, 2005

sample.configure added.  Put this file in a scmxlate-configured package and
name it 'configure'

Allow ((...) ...) in subsexps of if, unless and when.  (I.e., funcalls will
be automatically inserted.)

Sept 8, 2004

If $COMSPEC is set (i.e., it's a Windows box), and $TERM is cygwin, then
consider OS to be unix.

July 15, 2003

CL xln of call-with-output-string bugfixed.

May 30, 2003

Allow compile option for Chicken.

Use date of release instead of (cooked up) version numbers.

v 1a10a

May 29, 2003

Remove predefn of eof for Gauche, as it is 
written out as unreadable object.  Remove
use of file-mtime as it depends on (use file.util).

v 1a10

May 27, 2003

Alex Shinn supplied configuration for Gauche.

v 1a9

Mar 25, 2003

Translate define-macro into define-syntax for
MzScheme version 200+. 

v 1a8

Mar 9, 2003

s/scmxlate-ignore/scmxlate-ignore-define/ 

v 1a7

Feb 9, 2003

Use pretty-print for Guile.

resolve-aliases shouldn't if *reading-source-file?*

Feb 8, 2003

scm2cl: Recognize struct-accessors as global functions.

Use pp (pretty-printer) for MIT Scheme.

Translate inexact->exact as identity.

Insert funcalls for top-level expr inside lambda-body
if it begins with two left parens.

Jan 18, 2003

with-input-from-port, with-output-to-port

v 1a6

Jan 11, 2003

Allow self-recursions of the sort

(define fname 
  (lambda (...)
    (... fname (as value) ...)))

v 1a5

Dec 15, 2002

resolve-aliases s/be called only when reading
source file.

Dec 13, 2002

current-seconds.  

Remove Scheme file-or-directory-modify-seconds ==
CL file-write-date because they have a 70-year
age difference.

Dec 11, 2002

Scsh 0.6.2: close-input-port of input string port
says Error: returning zero values when one is expected
(values).  Removing it for now.

Scheme48 won't tolerate \n in strings, even if
it's deadcode!  So I can't use \n for newline
in display's argument string. :-(

v 1a4

Dec 10, 2002

STKlos 0.53.

For CLISP (only), set *print-pretty* to t so calls to
princ inside scmxlate-insert work like Scheme
display with no gratuitous newlines.  (info from Sam
Steingold.)

v 1a3

Dec 7, 2002

CL banner uses lisp-implementation-{type,version}

SBCL

v 1a2

Dec 3, 2002

Support for Chicken added.

Nov 29, 2002

Guile 1.6.0's eval can't be called with just one
argument. 

Nov 27, 2002

MIT Scheme seems to now use syntactic closure macros
rather than syntax-table-define.  Accommodate.

Nov 24, 2002

Reject compile request for Chez/Petite if
it's really Petite.  Use (eqv? (current-eval)
compile) trick suggested by Gustavo Gomez.

v 1a1

Nov 24, 2002

Add code in scm2cl.cl so, when called by itself,
it displays the same version number as scmxlate.

Nov 23, 2002

Fix scmxlate's response to a user request for compile.
Shell-magic lines are preserved.  CL's compile-file
(or maybe just CLISP's) doesn't seem to allow an
extensionless source filename -- add workaround.

v 1a

Nov 23, 2002

Replace scmxlate-disable-main with
the more general scmxlate-uncall.

Documentation now covers all relevant 
aspects!  Version finally jumps to 1!

Nov 22, 2002

Replace scmxlate-when with the more versatile
scmxlate-cond.  Added scmxlate-eval, so 
scmxlate-cond and scmxlate-insert have something
substantial to munch on.

Nov 21, 2002

Reduce the number of config files needed in dialects/
subdiry to one per source file.  To this end, add
the following commands:
  scmxlate-insert
  scmxlate-postamble
  scmxlate-postprocess

v 0o

Nov 20, 2002

Added documentation about writing an scmxlate
configuration.  (Lots TBD.)

Shorten some filenames. 
s/scm2cl-names/clnames
s/scm2cl-macros/clmacros
s/scheme-procs/clprocs

Treat #' of local procedure names introduced by
labels (from non-TR named-let) correctly.

Can't believe scm2cl didn't tackle letrec till
now!  I guess I tend to use named-let instead. 

Use scm2cl to translate parts of scmxlate.scm for
scmxlate.cl, so I can concentrate effort on
scmxlate.scm and not worry that scmxlate.cl won't
be up-to-date. 

Nov 19, 2002

Added scmxlate-when.

Nov 17, 2002

Added makefile for my own use.

v 0n

Nov 10, 2002

CL: Translate set! of global vars that were previously
defuns into setf's of symbol-functions.  So
(define foo <proc>) followed by (set! foo <proc>) 
allows foo to continue to be treated as 
a global function albeit with a new value.
Of course, we have to ensure the new value
is also a procedure, but that's probably an ok
restriction.

Nov 4, 2002

Check for MzScheme version (< or >= 200) made more
robust.  Input from Paul Steckler.

Nov 1, 2002

Translate define-syntax into define-macro for PLT
versions before 200.

v 0m

15 Sep 2002

CL: If first line of file-to-be-ported starts with #,
ignore it.  

CL: Heads of case clause should be pruned of 
#'.

26 Mar 2002

scmxlate-rename just renames a symbol in the source.
scmxlate-rename-define furthermore eliminates its
definition in the source. 

25 Mar 2002

add *predefined-aliases* that is dialect-dependent

v 0L1

24 Mar 2002

scmxlate.cl now uses cl pathnames instead of
os-dependent stringy pathnames.  (Uses :relative which
isn't in CLtL1 -- I hope this doesn't break on
older CLs)

scmxlate-disable-main

23 Mar 2002

scmxlate calls translates the cl version of
each sexp rather than scm2cl'ing the entire file
and then translating that result.  This allows
scmxlate config for cl (which is written in cl)
to be more natural, ie, it doesn't have to know
what the intermediate cl-translation looks like

Allow defstructs to be overridden

Added scmxlate-prefix, scmxlate-include, and allow
scmxlate[-dialect[-os]]-start-<file> in dialects/

When renaming x to y, we can also ignore any 
definition for x.

22 Mar 2002

Added scmxlate-compile?
as option specifiable in user-override file

21 Mar 2002

Use distinct names: scmxlate-ignore,
scmxlate-rename

Allow user overrides in file
scmxlate-<file-to-be-ported>

Added scmxlate-target-file, which allows user to set
*target-file*, which can be fruitfully used by
package-writer-supplied configuration code in
dialects/ to make ready-to-run scripts

v 0L

19 Mar 2002

Included the Scheme-to-Scheme porting mechanism from
tex2page (also schelog) into this (formerly scm2cl)
distribution, and rename latter to scmxlate.  It still
contains scm2cl as an independently usable
submodule.  scmxlate is thus a general
configuration tool that translates a Scheme package to
a variety of Scheme dialects and Common Lisp.

--- I include here some history of the porting mechanism
from tex2page.

--- 16 Mar 2002

tex2page's to-Common-Lisp porting method made general
(ie, not specific to tex2page), just like the
Scheme-to-Scheme method.

changes to porting mechanism to help make
it more easily customizable in the 
"dialects" directory -- defignore,
defalias.  don't wait for user input
if singleton files dialects-supported.scm
and operating-systems-supported.scm found
in dialects/

--- 31 Jan 2002

Scheme 48

-- 16 Dec 2001

Low-level define-syntax as implemented in MzScheme.
Convert this to defmacro for dialects that need it.
Thing to note: Petite and SXM's low-level define-syntax is
almost like MzScheme's but with a slightly less
convenient semantics for the procedure datum->syntax-object.

--- 18 Jan 2001

SXM,  Pocket Scheme

--- 16 Jan 2001

Scsh

--- 13 Dec 2000

Move porting-related clutter into subdirectory "dialects".

--- 4 April 1999

Petite Chez Scheme

--- 16 April 1998

MIT Scheme

--- 14 April 1998

Guile

--- 24 April 1997

Extensible mechanism added for porting to various Scheme dialects
(MzScheme, Gambit).

--- end of sxmlate pre-history from tex2page

16 Mar 2002

Allow correct lexical shadowing of global
procedure names, where the new value can also be a
procedure.  These inner procs will acquire a funcall
since they are not global.

v 0k3

20 Mar 2001

define translates to defparameter (not defvar)
so a later define overwrites an earlier define
of the same identifier 

v 0k2

6 Jan 2001

(MzScheme) flush-output = (CL) force-output 

Dec 19, 2000

getenv = system:getenv, for ACL and CLISP

v 0k1

Dec 17, 2000

string->symbol is more Scheme-y.
Leading-colon strings are cvted to keywords.
All-lowercase strings are cvted to all-uppercase
symbols, so symbols can remain unescaped in both
Scheme and CL.  In general, a lowercase char
in the string becomes an uppercase char in the
symbol and an uppercase char becomes a lowercase.
  ":keyword" -> :keyword
  "symbol"   -> symbol
  "SYMBOL"   -> |symbol|
  "SyMbOL"   -> |sYmBoL|

v 0k

Dec 16, 2000

Allow dotted data in source.

string->number should work on "" too
(it's defined using read-from-string, which
should return nil on eof instead of erroring)

struct-setter-p (scm2cl-macros.cl) shouldn't
error on nonsymbols

v 0j1

Nov 28, 2000

labels (xln of named-let) correction.  The 
args of the procs it introduces shd be 
allowed to be procs themselves.

v 0j

Nov 23, 2000

with-input-from-file, with-output-to-file
load-relative

v 0i

Nov 2, 2000

Change CL defmacro's rest arg from just
__syntax-rules-arg__ to 
(&rest __syntax-rules-arg__) because CL spec seems (?)
to disallow former.  Sugg by Rainer Joswig
(joswig@corporate-world.lisp.de)

v. 0h

Apr 2, 2000

(define x (let ((y ...)) (lambda ...))) converted to
(let ((y ...)) (defun x ...)) 

v. 0g

Oct 9, 1999

Procs introduces by an earlier entry in a let* should be
usable in subsequent entries.

Treat cond-clause that has only one element (which is
both test and then-expression).

v. 0f

Oct 3, 1999

Give uppercase char to set-dispatch-macro-character.
Shouldn't matter ideally, but a version of CLISP choked.

v. 0e

Feb 14, 1999

current-input-port, current-output-port

v. 0d

Feb 11, 1999

A Scheme version of defstruct supported.

April 27, 1998

v. 0c

scheme-procs.cl not included automatically in
translation (it is hardly ever needed).

Only those named lets whose names begin (rather than
contain) the substring "loop" are converted into CL
loops

April 18, 1998

v. 0b

let-syntax and letrec-syntax treated.

Made funcall-insertion better by keeping track of
bound variables.

=> in cond recognized.

April 27, 1997

v. 0a
